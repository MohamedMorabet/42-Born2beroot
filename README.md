# Born2BeRoot: A Guide to Master Virtualization and System Configuration

Hello, and welcome to the **Born2BeRoot** project! My name is **Mohammed El Morabet**, and I am a student at **1337 School (42 Network)**. I'm thrilled to share this guide with you and help you navigate this incredible learning experience. If you're exploring virtualization and virtual machines for the first time, you're in for an enriching journey. This project is a cornerstone for understanding core concepts like virtual machines, hypervisors, LVM (Logical Volume Management), and much more. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this guide will help you stay on track and extract the most value from the project.

## üìå **About the Project**

The Born2BeRoot project is designed to teach critical concepts in system administration and virtualization. It provides hands-on experience with:
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Hypervisors and virtualization techniques
- Logical Volume Management (LVM)
- Partitioning and disk management
- System services and their configurations
- Understanding and implementing security protocols
- And much more!

This project requires meticulous attention to detail and understanding of every step you perform. The final evaluation isn't just about completing tasks but understanding *why* you do them and how they impact the system.

## üõ§Ô∏è **Your Learning Path**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you stay on track and minimize confusion:

### 1. **Setting Up Your Virtual Machine**
   - Choose your operating system. The recommended choice is **Debian**.
   - Follow this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/73r3JbkCVy0?si=TMvKlE8WHsMrKCoZ) to set up your virtual machine. It covers the basics and ensures your environment is ready for the project.

### 2. **Mandatory Part: Installation and Configuration**
   - Begin by installing and configuring the mandatory requirements of the project. 
   - Use this detailed [Born2BeRoot guide](https://github.com/pasqualerossi/Born2BeRoot-Guide/blob/main/README.md) starting from **Part 4**.

### 3. **Bonus Part: Going Beyond**
   - After completing the mandatory tasks, move on to the bonus section for additional learning and to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
   - Use this [Bonus Part Tutorial](https://github.com/ayoub0x1/born2beroot?tab=readme-ov-file#bonus) to guide you.

## üí° **Tips and Hints**

### **Understanding and Awareness**
- Avoid blindly following tutorials. Take time to understand *why* each step is necessary.
- Ensure you know how to:
  - Locate and explain the paths of all your configuration files.
  - Use and explain critical commands related to system management and troubleshooting.

### **Deep Dive into Concepts**
- **Logical Volume Management (LVM):** This is a critical topic. Make sure to study it in depth.
- System services: Choose services thoughtfully for the bonus part and ensure you understand their purpose and configuration.

### **Evaluation Preparedness**
- During evaluation, you'll be asked in-depth questions about your setup. Be ready to explain:
  - The choices you made
  - Why certain configurations were necessary
  - How each part of the system works together

## üìñ **Sample Evaluation Walkthrough**

Here‚Äôs a sample walkthrough of what the evaluation process may involve:

1. **General Questions**
   - What is a hypervisor, and how does it work?
   - Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors.
   - Why did you choose Debian as your operating system?

2. **Configuration Questions**
   - Show the partitioning setup on your virtual machine.
   - Explain how LVM works and why it‚Äôs useful.
   - Demonstrate how to check the status of services on your system.

3. **Practical Tasks**
   - Modify a service configuration and explain the changes.
   - Troubleshoot a hypothetical error in your setup.
   - Add a new user to your system with specific permissions.

4. **Bonus Tasks**
   - If applicable, demonstrate the service you configured for the bonus part and explain your choices.

## ‚ùì **FAQ: Common Questions**

### 1. **What is the difference between mandatory and bonus parts?**
The mandatory part ensures the basic functionality of the system. The bonus part challenges you to go beyond the basics, often involving custom configurations or additional features.

### 2. **Do I need to memorize all the commands?**
No, but you should understand the purpose of each command and how it works. Resources like [ExplainShell](https://explainshell.com/) can help you break down complex commands.

### 3. **What should I do if I encounter errors during setup?**
- Double-check the tutorial or documentation you‚Äôre following.
- Use error logs to identify the issue (`journalctl`, `dmesg`, or specific service logs).
- Search for solutions online or consult with peers.

### 4. **How do I prepare for the evaluation?**
- Practice explaining each step of your setup process.
- Review your configuration files and ensure you can locate them quickly.
- Familiarize yourself with commands to check services, manage users, and troubleshoot errors.
