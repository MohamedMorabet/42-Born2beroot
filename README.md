# Born2BeRoot: A Guide to Master Virtualization and System Configuration

Welcome to the **Born2BeRoot** project! If you're exploring virtualization and virtual machines for the first time, you're in for an enriching journey. This project is a cornerstone for understanding core concepts like virtual machines, hypervisors, LVM (Logical Volume Management), and much more. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this guide will help you navigate the process and extract the most value from this learning experience.

## üìå **About the Project**

The Born2BeRoot project is designed to teach critical concepts in system administration and virtualization. It provides hands-on experience with:
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Hypervisors and virtualization techniques
- Logical Volume Management (LVM)
- Partitioning and disk management
- System services and their configurations
- Understanding and implementing security protocols
- And much more!

This project requires meticulous attention to detail and understanding of every step you perform. The final evaluation isn't just about completing tasks but understanding *why* you do them and how they impact the system.

## üõ§Ô∏è **Your Learning Path**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you stay on track and minimize confusion:

### 1. **Setting Up Your Virtual Machine**
   - Choose your operating system. The recommended choice is **Debian**.
   - Follow this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/73r3JbkCVy0?si=TMvKlE8WHsMrKCoZ) to set up your virtual machine. It covers the basics and ensures your environment is ready for the project.

### 2. **Mandatory Part: Installation and Configuration**
   - Begin by installing and configuring the mandatory requirements of the project. 
   - Use this detailed [Born2BeRoot guide](https://github.com/pasqualerossi/Born2BeRoot-Guide/blob/main/README.md) starting from **Part 4**.

### 3. **Bonus Part: Going Beyond**
   - After completing the mandatory tasks, move on to the bonus section for additional learning and to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
   - Use this [Bonus Part Tutorial](https://github.com/ayoub0x1/born2beroot?tab=readme-ov-file#bonus) to guide you.

## üí° **Tips and Hints**

### **Understanding and Awareness**
- Avoid blindly following tutorials. Take time to understand *why* each step is necessary.
- Ensure you know how to:
  - Locate and explain the paths of all your configuration files.
  - Use and explain critical commands related to system management and troubleshooting.

### **Deep Dive into Concepts**
- **Logical Volume Management (LVM):** This is a critical topic. Make sure to study it in depth.
- System services: Choose services thoughtfully for the bonus part and ensure you understand their purpose and configuration.

### **Evaluation Preparedness**
- During evaluation, you'll be asked in-depth questions about your setup. Be ready to explain:
  - The choices you made
  - Why certain configurations were necessary
  - How each part of the system works together

### **Optional Enhancements**
- If you're doing only the mandatory part, ensure your VM partitioning and configuration are flawless.
- Consider implementing scripts or automations to streamline repetitive tasks.
